# Proxy

## Proxy I have experience with

### netnut
Very reliable and good proxy provider, but quite expensive.
Can be used for complex projects to bypass quite strong security systems

https://netnut.io/


### oxylabs
Pretty good for basic tasks. Cheap enough, but blacklisted on most social networks.

https://oxylabs.io/


### smartproxy
Almost the same as oxylabs but slightly worse

# Capthca solver

## Capthca solver I have experience with

### 2Capthca
The most popular service. Pretty good and have a lot of supported captchas, but have low accuracy with dificult captchas. 
If a Captcha was not solved you don't pay anything.

### capsolver
More reliable that 2Capthca but more expensive. Allow explicit capthca solving.
